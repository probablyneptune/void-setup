# void-setup
this will setup void

this script is for **nvidia only**
i have no idea what packages are for amd or intel gpus

# do not forget to make this an executable
(else it won't work, obviously)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/probablyneptune/void-setup

cd ~ && cd void-setup
chmod +x setup.sh
```
